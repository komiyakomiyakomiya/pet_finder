She likes to cuddle when she is sleepy and also when she wakes up from a nap. As long as she has her toys, she keeps herself active and busy during the day. Would recommend you spend at least half an hour every night to play with her as it is her normal routine now. Would recommend that you house her alone as a single cat or with another kitten. She has had her second vaccination and deworming and needs another one next month. Serious adopters only please. Looking for a good forever home for Kali. For more info/photos please whatsapp\n",
